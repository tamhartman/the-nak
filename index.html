            <h1>So What is Kava And Where Does it Come From?</h1>
            <h2>Get the low down</h2>
            <p>Kava is a beverage from the South Pacific Islands, traditionally made from the roots of the Kava Kava plant (piper methysticum) and water. On islands such as Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and Hawaii kava has been used ceremoniously for over 3,000 years. Kava has been an integral part of culture of these societies, being used for important ceremonies such as rights of passages, births, marriages, funerals to daily activities such as opening bank accounts or having over a gathering of friends.
                <br>
                    Today in the United States, as it has been used for centuries on the other side of the world, we enjoy kava socially to bring people and communities together. This ancient beverage uplifts the mind and relaxes the body. The calming effects of kava may ease anxiety, depression, and muscle tension and the root is also known to have antimicrobial and antibacterial properties.
                    <br> 
                    The Kava served at the Nak is fashioned after the processes in Vanuatu, where the majority of our kava is imported from.
